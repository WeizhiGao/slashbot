## New Feature Update: Split System

We've added a new "Split system" feature to the program. Now, users can use our slashbot to log expenses for multiple members, recording the exact amount and item of each person's expenditure. Simultaneously, this new feature allows the specification of debtors and payers, taking into account that during group spending activities, some might pay on behalf of others.

Suppose there's a group spending scenario. Calculating how much each person should transfer to others can be a complicated process. Our new feature addresses this challenge perfectly. By inputting each person's actual expenditure and payments, you can swiftly determine how much each member should collect or pay to others. We believe that this new functionality greatly expands slashbot's use-cases, transitioning it from a purely personal application to one suitable for group scenarios.

## Inspiration for the New Feature:

The inspiration came from an outing with our team members. During the trip, some members did not carry their credit cards, lacking feasible payment methods, so others in the group covered their expenses. By the end of the day, when we gathered to calculate the day's expenses, we found the process of splitting the bill to be somewhat cumbersome. This experience led us to wonder: why not add a new feature to slashbot to address this issue? Hence, the Split System was born.
