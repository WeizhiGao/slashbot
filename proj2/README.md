## New Feature Update: AA System

We've added a new "AA system" feature to the program. Now, users can use our slashbot to log expenses for multiple members, recording the exact amount and item of each person's expenditure. Simultaneously, this new feature allows the specification of debtors and payers, taking into account that during group spending activities, some might pay on behalf of others.

Suppose there's a group spending scenario. Calculating how much each person should transfer to others can be a complicated process. Our new feature addresses this challenge perfectly. By inputting each person's actual expenditure and payments, you can swiftly determine how much each member should collect or pay to others. We believe that this new functionality greatly expands slashbot's use-cases, transitioning it from a purely personal application to one suitable for group scenarios.
